	\begin{theorem}[Pythagorean theorem]
  \label{pythagorean}
  This is a theorem about right triangles and can be summarised in the next 
  equation 
  \[ x^2 + y^2 = z^2 \]
  \end{theorem}

  And a consequence of theorem \ref{pythagorean} is the statement, that there's no right rectangle whose sides measure 3cm, 4cm, and 6cm.
